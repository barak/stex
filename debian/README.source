stex for Debian
---------------

Upstream's Makefile compiles a few binaries. However, these depend on
the exact Chez Scheme version that compiled them. But stex is a
build-dependency of chezscheme, which makes building stex and
chezscheme complicated. Therefore this package has the uncompiled
programs instead, which is a case that upstream supports.
